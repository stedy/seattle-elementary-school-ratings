# Seattle Elementary School Ratings
I have had many conversations with parents about Seattle schools and the
perception if they are a "good" or "bad" school. I was frustrated that while Seattle Public Schools maintains a data
[repository](https://www.seattleschools.org/cms/One.aspx?portalId=627&pageId=6369011), much of this data is hard to parse and summarize. I was able to find standardized test rating data from the 2017-18 school year so I formatted it into an R Shiny app for hopefully better understanding the ratings of Seattle Elementary Schools.
